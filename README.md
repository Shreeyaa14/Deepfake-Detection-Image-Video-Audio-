The Advanced Deepfake Detection Project elucidates whether the give file (Image, Video, Audio) is Morphed/ Deep faked or its Original. The Novelty of this project includes the Integrated Deepfake Detection where 3 types of files are analyzed and detected in a single website where the upload button in the website supports all of these file types. The output will be displayed as whether the uploaded file is Morphed or not, its Confidence Percentage, Morphed frames/ regions/ segments, the file type and the file is displayed if it is Morphed. The factors/criteria taken to analyze the morphing are the difference in lightings, skin color, color grading, impossible scenarios for the images, whereas facial expressions, body languages, color mismatch, impossible scenarios, frame inconsistencies for the videos, and finally difference in the voice, tone, content and context of the segments of the audio.
