# Deepfake-Detection-Image-Video-Audio-
The Deepfake Detection Project analyzes images, videos, and audio to identify morphing through a single upload interface. It displays the file type, morph status, confidence score, and affected areas based on visual, behavioral, and audio inconsistencies. The integration of all 3 files in a single website enhances the novelty of the project.
